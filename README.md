# sGLOH_opencv

For this project the objective is to incorporate the sGLOH (scale-invariant Gradient Location and Orientation Histogram) descriptor into the OpenCV environment, employing C++ as our coding language. This project will implement and evaluate the sGLOH descriptor and its performance compared to SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) approach, which constitutes our benchmark for assessment.

 This work is based on the following paper:
 Bellavia, Fabio, and Carlo Colombo. "Rethinking the sGLOH descriptor." IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 40.4 (2017): 931-944.

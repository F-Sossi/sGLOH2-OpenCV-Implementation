## Test Scripts
This directory contains python scripts for running the project repeatedly and cleaning up output.
These scripts were used for evaluating sGLOH vs SIFT for writing the paper, but are
not necessary for running the project.

This full test set takes about 2 hours to run on a 2.4 GHz Intel Core i5 processor.
Using the included images it will query 9 images against a library of 72 images.
